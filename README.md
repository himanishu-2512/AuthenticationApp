# AuthenticationApp

AuthenticationApp is an Express.js application designed to provide user registration, authentication, secure routes, user roles and authorization, password reset functionality, security measures, and logging capabilities. Below are the features and implementation details of the application:

## Features

1. **Create an Express.js Application**
   - Initialize a new Express.js application to serve as the foundation for AuthenticationApp.

2. **User Registration and Authentication**
   - Implement user registration with email and password.
   - Store user information securely, including password hashing using libraries like bcrypt.
   - Implement user login with token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Return a JWT token upon successful login for subsequent authenticated requests.

3. **Secure Routes**
   - Create a set of routes that are protected and require a valid JWT token for access.
   - Implement middleware for JWT validation to secure these routes and ensure authenticated access.

4. **User Roles and Authorization**
   - Implement a basic role-based access control system with roles like "user" and "admin."
   - Restrict access to certain routes based on the user's role.
   - Admins should have additional permissions compared to regular users.

5. **Password Reset**
   - Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their passwords securely through an email-based process.

6. **Security Measures**
   - Implement security headers to prevent common web security vulnerabilities such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
   - Utilize appropriate libraries and techniques to secure against other common attacks and vulnerabilities.

7. **Logging**
   - Implement a basic logging system to record user activities and security-related events for auditing and monitoring purposes.

## Implementation Details

- **Express.js Application Setup**: AuthenticationApp is built on top of Express.js, providing a robust and scalable foundation for handling HTTP requests and middleware.
- **User Authentication and Registration**: User authentication and registration functionality are implemented using email and password. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Authentication is performed using JWT tokens, which are issued upon successful login and used to authorize access to protected routes.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: AuthenticationApp implements role-based access control, allowing administrators to have additional permissions compared to regular users. Certain routes are restricted based on user roles.
- **Password Reset via Email**: Users can securely reset their passwords through a password reset feature that utilizes a secure email-based process.
- **Security Measures**: AuthenticationApp includes security measures such as implementing security headers to mitigate common web security vulnerabilities and utilizing appropriate libraries to secure against other potential attacks.
- **Logging System**: A basic logging system is integrated into AuthenticationApp to record user activities and security-related events, facilitating auditing and monitoring of system activities.

AuthenticationApp prioritizes security, user privacy, and ease of use to provide a reliable authentication and authorization solution for web applications.
